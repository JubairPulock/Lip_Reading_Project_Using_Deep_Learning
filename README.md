# Lip_Reading_Project_Using_Deep_Learning
Lip reading model: A deep learning model that can extract speech from a video of a silent talking face. Approach: Uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract visual and temporal features from a sequence of image frames. Potential applications: Helping people with hearing loss, security, and video surveillance.
